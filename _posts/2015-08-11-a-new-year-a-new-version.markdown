It's great to be back!

I hope everyone's had an excellent summer. To the newest class of Freshman, welcome to CNU!
We're stoked you're here, and thanks for checking out DiningBuddy. If you're new and wondering
what this is all about, check out the [about page](/about) for all the information on the app!

As things kick back into gear, a brand new update for iPhone and Android is available, built just for
the new year. Version 1.2 brings a fully redesigned interface for all of you on Apple devices,
and a brand new feed system for everyone.

Now you can use the dining hall feed to have discussion and share information about what's going on.
This feature allows those who are currently in the dining hall to give feedback on how crowded it is so that
you'll know what to expect when you get there. You can see people in the feed who are in the dining hall with
the red pin marker, and click their post to see the status information.

The networking systems for the new version on both devices has also been completely rewritten to ensure the
app is speedy, and feels a lot faster to use. This update also improves battery life on Android tremendously,
while still making the app quicker and more responsive!

I'm looking forward to the biggest year ever for DiningBuddy. Over 500 students have already downloaded the app
and are helping to make social dining at CNU a reality. Help spread the word if you like the app!

Go Captains!
