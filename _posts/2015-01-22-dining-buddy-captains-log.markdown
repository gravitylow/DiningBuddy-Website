That's the headline of the news article about DiningBuddy, thanks to the excellent work of Josh Reyes at the Captain's Log!

It's incredibly cool to see everything taking off. I learned a lot just working on this project, and to see what I 
worked on actually be used and talked about is just the most amazing thing. I'm really glad everyone has found it so
useful!

As many people are aware, the iOS version currently available (1.0.2) has some location bugs. A couple hours after releasing 
DiningBuddy, I was notified that some people's iOS devices weren't updating the fact that they were in one of the dining 
halls, even when they really were. After frantically eating dinner and running over to Einstein's to do some debugging, 
I realized the GPS accuracy I had assumed would work fine for my purposes was actually nowhere near sharp enough to 
pinpoint users in the dining halls. In fact, locations were only updating every few kilometers. 

This obviously presents a huge issue, so it had to be fixed. I have good news along with today's post which is that
the updated build (1.0.3) has just cleared Apple's App Review and will be hitting the store in a couple hours! It's
likely that I'll be posting an in-app alert to the older version to help ensure that people get updated and can actually
use the app as it was meant to be used! If you do use iOS, I would recommend keeping an eye on the app store to grab
the update as soon as you can.

Thanks to everyone for your support, even through the ridiculous bugs. 

Go Captains!
