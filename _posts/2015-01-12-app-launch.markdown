Just in time for the 2015 Spring semester and after countless hours writing over 10,000 lines of code in 3 different
languages, DiningBuddy is officially live! If you'd like to learn a bit more about the details of the service, you can
visit the [about page](/about).

I'm excited to see the outcome of this experiment when it's put in the hands of everyone on campus. If you want to help
make the service the best that it can be, please help me with the following:

1. Open the app often when in a dining area and leave **feedback**.
2. Report any **bugs** you encounter by emailing me at ad@mfendley.com with details. I respond to every email.
3. **Tell your friends**, and get them to download the app! The more users there are to provide data, the more accurate
predictions can be about how crowded the dining halls are.
4. If you're interested in **beta testing** new versions of the app for either iOS or Android and giving feedback, shoot me 
an email and let me know.

If you feel so inclined, you can help me out personally by **donating**. We college students can be pretty cheap which
is exactly why I've made the apps completely free, even cutting out advertising because I dislike it myself. However, 
companies like Apple charge large yearly payments in order to submit apps to their stores. I've decided to cover these
costs myself, but if you'd like to help out, [feel free to pitch in](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=DCFNRJR2WJPKW&lc=US&item_name=DiningBuddy%20Development&item_number=diningbuddy%2ddevelopment&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted). 
Your support is greatly appreciated.
