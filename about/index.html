<p>DiningBuddy is a social dining experiment created for Christopher Newport University.</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to create a social dining experience on campus that allows students to share information
about the dining halls from their smartphones.</p>
<p>By using the location services of these devices and a digital GPS
coordinate-based map of campus, it is possible to determine how many students using the app are present in a dining
hall at any given time. By combining this data with information provided by students about how crowded their dining hall
is, the service attempts to make a prediction about the overall status of the location.</p>
